## Health Insurance Cost Predictor

1. Why should anyone care about this question?
   Understanding these types of costs can greatly help patients and business owners. By making a machine learning model that predicts these values, business owners can allocate the proper resources financially to ensure     that workers are getting the healthcare that they need. This can also help with making health insurance more accessible to people who have lower income.
2. What question am I trying to answer?
   Can a machine learning model accurately predict health care costs for patients based on certain characteristics?
3. What data will I use to answer this question?
   I will use publically available datasets (Kaggle, UCI, etc.) which contain features such as age, sex, smoker status, # of children, etc. in order to make the model.
4. What methods am I using to answer this question?
   Data Preprocessing, EDA, Feature Selection, Feature Engineering, Various ML model implementations (Regression models), and model evaluation.
5. What did your research find?
   I found that the trait most associated with the charges a person would face is their smoking status, smokers on average have a much higher amount of charges than non-smokers. I also found that the patients in the         south-east region have the most cost and highest average cost of insurance.
6. Next steps?
   If I were to keep iterating on this problem, I would source more data from other sources where it is allowed to get more variation in data, I would try to add more specific features such as state/city so that I can a     more comprehensive understanding of the charge distribution.
